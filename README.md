# charlesreid1.com pelican theme

This Pelican theme provides templates for charlesreid1.com pages.

How it works:

* Create an index landing page
* Create main landing pages for each sub-category (about/consulting/writing/projects/etc)
* Landing pages may use theme templates, or may define totally different stuff.
* New/separate apps go in their own folder, see pelicanconf.py

To customize the navbar, edit the file `templates/_includes/navbar.html`.

Also note, this is the base theme. Other themes that should be updated accordingly:

* Charlesreid1.com wiki theme
* charlesreid1.github.io theme
